=======

Control the VAIO laptop specific features.
Tested on a SVF15 (Fit 15) series laptop, it will probably
fail on the other models.

Run the script without arguments for more information.

Supported features:
* Battery care
* Fan
* Keyboard backlight
* Touchpad
* USB charge (power when laptop is turned off)

Backends: EC vs SL
==================
Two backends are available. The current version, "vaioctl",
uses the ec_sys module to directly access the embedded controller
(EC) inside the laptop.
The older version, "vaioctl-sl", uses the sony_laptop module.

EC backend allows the fan speed to be read, and it can read the
current status of keyboard backlight without needing to set it first.

In comparison, sony_laptop backend cannot read the fan speed at all,
and it cannot read the backlight status (it remembers the last
written setting instead).

However, EC backend requires root access for all actions, whereas
sony_laptop can read the values as a normal user.
